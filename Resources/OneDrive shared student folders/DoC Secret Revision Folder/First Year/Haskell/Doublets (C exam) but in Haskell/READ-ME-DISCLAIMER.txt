 This is originally the "doublets" C exam, but I decided to do
    the implementation in Haskell, the spec is attached. 

    If you're preparing for the Haskell exam and don't wanna do past exams, 
    this is good practice, it uses the recursion heavily as well higher-order
    functions.

    Even if you haven't done C, you can understand the spec easily, it's just 
    the doublets game. I did not exactly follow the C spec for this, but I just implemented
    the WordTree data structure 


    Run the game with > search <word1> <word2> <chain_size>
    and it will return whether there exists a chain of the 
    given size from word1 to word2, given the dictionary
    "words.txt"

    Stuff like this is so much simpler in Haskell
