Hi :) I made some SED notes while I was in 2nd year and thought people in future
years might find them useful!

Small disclaimer, I have checked for and corrected as many mistakes as I (and
others in my year) could find, but there's no 100% guarantee that everything in
there is perfect.

Also, the section on TDD on the first page doesn't have code examples in it - in
the slides we were given in our year (also uploaded in this folder), Rob goes
through it in Python and JavaScript but in the first CW you'll do TDD so you'll
find what libraries and methods you like using to test your code.

Hope this helps, and if you do spot a mistake don't hesitate to correct it in the
word doc!

P.S. Word Online is probably going to mess up the formatting of the .docx, so just
look at the .pdf if you aren't correcting any mistakes :)
