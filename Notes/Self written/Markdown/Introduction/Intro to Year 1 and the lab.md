## Year Coordinator (cont'd)

- Konstantinos is the year coordinator
- [email](kgk@ic.ac.uk)
- kgk is his shortcode, can be contacted on teams if you have a question and you dont know who to ask
- All issues affecting the first year of studies, such as a missing git repository or no access to Scienta/LabTS
- If you have an issue that is caused by you, he is not the person to speak

## Small group tutorials

- GTA = Postgarduate Teaching assistants. MMT tutors and lab helpers.
- UTAs = Undergraduate Teaching Assistants
- PPTs = Personalised Programming Tutorial
- PMTs = Personalised Mathematics Tutorials (but are actually focused on discrete maths). PMTs do not start for a while. Math students do not take discrete maths.
- MMTs = Are only for Computing Students

-PPTs, PMTs and MMTs only run in term 1 and 2

## How to succeed in first year

- Attend and watch all lectures and read any lecture notes
- Attend all PPT/PMT/MMT sessions (PPT and PMT are unassessed but marked)
- Revise before tests and exams
- Make friends
- Inform senior tutor before any deadlines if you're ill
- Inform PPT/PMT tutors before missing any tutorials
- Ask for help if you need help. We meet you every week but sometimes you can really hide your stress and being overwhelmed.

## How to fail in your first year

- Join too many clubs and societies that you have no time to study and sleep
- Party every night, miss the session at 9 am and 10 am
- Study all the time and ignore all your friends and unfit and unhealthy
- Miss tutorials, and don't submit their exercises
- Submit another student's work as your own and is plagiarism. This includes if you use chatgpt
- Assume that you just because you have the notes and the videos on panopto and the material is already in your head
- Miss a chunk of term time because you have gone skiing or have focused on getting jobs
- Falsely believe a second year students that you dont need to study and just need to revise before your tests

## CSG

- Speak to them if you have any questions about your year

## JMC students year one

- 2 core modules from computing iwth coursework and exams
- 1 special module - coursework only - Computing Practical 1
- \+ Department of Mathematics modules

## One usual week in year 1

- Attend lectures
- Attend PMT/PPT tutorials
- Submit core module coursework
- Submit PPT exercise
- Submit PMT exercise
- Study
- Sleep
- Socialise
- Repeat

## Courseworks, test and exams

- Every module has coursework, usually one or two exercises
- COMP40009 has 6 tests in total
  - Haskell = 2
  - Kotlin = 2
  - C = 1 + Group project
- All exams are in the beginning of summer term
- Year 1 and 2 has exams in the summer term, year 3 and 4 are exams at the end of each term
- Each PPT is linked to what you're learning in COMP40009

## COMP40009

- Only module that runs 3 terms
- Term 1 - Haskell (W1-W6) and Kotlin (W7-W10) + Professional Issues and Ethics (Last week, autoassigned to group based on PPT and PMT colleagues). Kotlin in term 1 is completely unassessed and is to just see how it works.
- Term 2 - Kotlin only and a short intro to java.
- Term 3 - C (However without any PPT sessions) starts after exams.
- Haskell - 30%, Kotlin - 40%, Ethics - 10%
- PI and Ethics provides you research skills and ethics in computing
- CATe is no longer used, use scientia only this year
- Submit before the deadline and avoid submitting at the last minute as the system may be slower with everyone trying to submit
- Labs are released every monday morning at 8 am
- Deadline at Friday at 7 pm
- PPT UTAs will mark it and discuss it with you in your next PPT sessions
- All labs last one week
- Focus on feedback and not on the marks
- Length of PPT - 6 hours a week
  - 2 on Monday, Thursday and Friday with UTAs and GTAs that will help you to solve the PPT yourself
  - They will only give you advice but not actually tell you the answers

### Keywords

- Scientia
- GitLab
- LabTS
- EdStem
- Panopto
- Teams/zoom

### Scientia

- Where you find everything
- Notes, specs and deadliens
- Extra material and resources pointing to other places

### GitLab

- GitLab is a repository, like a storage place to store your code and documents online
- Has a repository created for you with all your content every time you do a PPT
- Don't need to store anything on your computer as everything will be stored on GitLab
- Every time you make a change, store it on GitLab, just commit and push your changes as you go

### LabTS

- Platform built at DoC
- To check your code to test the functionality of your code
- If some fails, you still have work to do
- It tells you what tests have been run with a pdf to download to check what has been checked
- You can create your own tests and your PPT UTA will tell you if they were good
- Your goal is to have as many test cases to pass as you can
- You can keep submitting new versions until the deadline but not after
- You can test locally as part of the skeleton file and don't need to run on LabTS until after you're sure your code runs
- Select submit this commit to submit a change
  - If it is green it means it has been submitted
- You can keep submitting newer versions all the way up to the deadline
- You are capped if you submit after the deadline for the first 24 hours
  - If you submit after the 24 hours you get 0%
  - Better to submit something that can get you 70% before the deadline rather than 40% after the deadline
- If you test something, it does not get auto submitted at the deadline
- You can submit a new version of your code and it will replace your previous submission

### EdStem

- A collection of a board of forums to discuss your questions

### Panopto

- A cloud website wiht live pre recorded lectures and other useful videos
- Containing captions
- Is useful for revision

### Teams

- You have full access to teams with imperial login
- Some lecturers use teams if they are not available in person

## FAQ

- I want linux, but I only have windows - you can download VirtualBox or VMware player and install linux
- I have a mac - MacOS is based on UNIX like linux but somethings may be different
- If we're sick and we can't make it to a programming test there is no retake.
  - At the end of the year there is an exam board that will check if you would have passed the exam or not and they will mark your module as passed or they will suggest that you take a retake for your test
  - For coursework, you get a deadline extension that will allow you to submit them at an extended deadline

- For COMP40009 - there are 5 lexis tests, 1 C group project and 1 professional issues project. In order to pass, you have to get not only:
  - 40% overall
  - 40% on the C group project
  - 50% on all the lexis tests combined. When these tests are combined based on the weightages give to them above.
- Out of the first year, COMP40009 is worth 20 ECTS out of 60.
- You should attend the problem classes to at least be able to socialise
- If you want to join a special module to learn to program competitively there is a following module:
  - **COMPM0701** is a special "module"
    - a series of 5 x 2h sessions (usually on Wednesday afternoon)
    - to prepare students for Competitive Programming contests
    - UKIEPC: 21/10/2023
    - NWERC: 25-26/11/2023
- There are scanners everywhere for free.
- You can chat with your classmates for exercises, but you shouldn't share your code. You can discuss answers.
